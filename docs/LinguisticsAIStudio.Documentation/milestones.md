**Milestone 1: Basic Structure and Data Display**

*   **Task 1.1: Project Setup**
    *   Create a GitHub repository for LinguisticsAIStudio.
    *   Initialize the project with the chosen Blazor WebAssembly template.
    *   Add Refit and Firebase Admin SDK as dependencies using NuGet.
    *   Configure basic project settings (e.g., .gitignore).
*   **Task 1.2: Data Models**
    *   Create C# classes for `Project`, `Prompt`, and `AIResult` to represent data structures.
    *   Define properties for each model based on the expected data (e.g., projectId, title, description, promptText, results). 
*   **Task 1.3: Refit Interfaces**
    *   Define Refit interfaces for `IProjectApi` and `IGoogleAiStudioApi`.
    *   Include methods for CRUD operations on projects and for executing prompts using Google AI Studio API.
*   **Task 1.4: Sample Data and Display**
    *   Create sample JSON data for projects (as shown previously) or connect to a temporary data source.
    *   Implement a Blazor component to fetch and display the project list using Refit.

**Milestone 2: Firestore Integration and CRUD Operations**

*   **Task 2.1: Firestore Setup**
    *   Create a Firestore database in the Firebase console.
    *   Configure Firebase authentication and security rules for your project. 
*   **Task 2.2: Firestore Service** 
    *   Implement a `FirestoreService` class to interact with Firestore using the Firebase Admin SDK.
    *   Include methods for CRUD operations on project and prompt data.
*   **Task 2.3: Replace Sample Data**
    *   Remove the sample JSON data or temporary data source.
    *   Update the Blazor component to fetch project data from Firestore using the `FirestoreService`. 
*   **Task 2.4: Implement CRUD Operations** 
    *   Create Blazor components and Refit methods for creating, editing, and deleting projects.
    *   Implement functionality to save and update project data in Firestore.

**Milestone 3: Google AI Studio API Integration**

*   **Task 3.1: Google AI Studio API Service**
    *   Implement the `GoogleAiStudioService` class using the `IGoogleAiStudioApi` Refit interface.
    *   Handle API requests and responses for prompt execution.
    *   Process and store the AI results from Google AI Studio API.
*   **Task 3.2: Prompt Management**
    *   Create Blazor components for users to create and edit custom prompts.
    *   Store prompt data in Firestore, linked to relevant projects. 
*   **Task 3.3: Prompt Execution** 
    *   Develop functionality to execute prompts using the `GoogleAiStudioService`.
    *   Display AI results to the user in a clear and informative way.

**Milestone 4: Authentication and Authorization**

*   **Task 4.1: User Authentication** 
    *   Implement a secure authentication mechanism (e.g., Firebase Authentication, JWT).
    *   Allow users to register, log in, and log out. 
*   **Task 4.2: Role-Based Access Control**
    *   Define user roles and permissions (e.g., admin, user). 
    *   Implement logic to restrict access to features and data based on user roles.

**Milestone 5: Additional Features and Refinements**

*   **Task 5.1: Error Handling and Logging**
    *   Implement robust error handling and logging throughout the application.
    *   Provide informative error messages to users. 
*   **Task 5.2: Input Validation and Security** 
    *   Sanitize user inputs to prevent XSS and injection attacks.
    *   Implement security best practices for handling sensitive data and API keys.
*   **Task 5.3: Testing**
    *   Write unit tests and integration tests to ensure code quality and functionality. 
*   **Task 5.4: User Interface Enhancements**
    *   Improve the UI/UX design of the application for better usability and aesthetics.
